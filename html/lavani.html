            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>Lavani is a combination of traditional song and dance which is performed to the dholki drum. Noted for its powerful rhythm and eroticism, Lavani has contributed to the development of Marathi folk theatre.In Maharashtra and southern Madhya Pradesh, it is performed by women wearing nine-yard-long saris. The songs are sung at a quick tempo.The Lavani dance originated as a form of morale booster for warring troops during the 18th and the 19th century when the state of Maharashtra was embroiled in conflict and turmoil.

                The dance form reached the peak of its popularity during the rule of the Peshawari Dynasty that was seated in Pune during which it was given support by the ruling elite.
                
                The Lavani dance is generally performed by Dhangars or shepherds living in the Sholapur district of Maharashtra. They are inspired by nature and the dance form contains tales of the birth of Biruba, their deity.
                
                The more commonly performed forms of the Lavani dance are concentrated in Maharashtra and are not restricted to the Dhangar community.

                                <h2 class="card-title" ></h2>Surekha Punekar is an Indian actress and folk artist known for her lavani performances.

                                Punekar came from a financially poor family and worked as a maid to make ends meet. In her initial days as an artist, she performed in the various Tamasha troupes on the lavanis written by the well-known poet Bashir Momin Kavathekar. After performing in various Tamasha troupes, she started her own Tamasha troupe with her sister Lata Punekar with support from Baba Pathan and Momin Kavathekar. This new troupe initially operated from Kavathe Yamai. However, the venture was unprofitable so the troupe closed. She then tried performing stage shows under the banner Natarangi Nar from 1998 onwards. Initially they received a cold response from the audience; she mentions once having performed for an audience of just three people.[1] However, the show eventually became famous, especially after she won first prize in the lavani competition held in Akluj Lavani Mahotsav. </h2>
